# kidney_exchange_eval

This repository contains the code used for evaluating the approach proposed in the paper "Optimal Algorithms for Generalized Stochastic Matching".

Files in the repo:
*.input - files containing kindey exchange instances from the dataset "Dataset for kidney exchange problems", https://rdm.inesctec.pt/dataset/ii-2019-001 (3 arbitrary instances of approperiate sizes)
kindey_exchange.cc - a c++ file simulating the algorithm proposed in the paper
results.pdf - a file contained the results of our algorithm on the 3 chosen instances
